# rick-and-morty

You can contribute to my project by using the following rick and morty project that I watched fondly.


### Setup

The project uses 
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) as a dependency manager.

Once you have CocoaPods installed you will need to run pod install.

```sh
$ pod install
```
